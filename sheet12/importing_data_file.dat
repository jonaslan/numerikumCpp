Importing data file:

1. The fstream member good() checks for three fail conditions:
	- if the imported value cannot be interpreted as its destination type (a string is imported but a double was expected).
	- There is something wrong with the file, for instance: it's unreadable or write/read-only.
	- the stream reaches an end of file bit.

2. eof stands for "end of file". The !import.eof() stands for not end of file named "import".

3. Because the >> operator relation reads right to left, a is read last.

4. If ++i was used instead of i++ the i variable would be incremented before the a variable was set, the index in a would be larger than in the corresponding b and c.
